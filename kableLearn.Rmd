## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]

kable(dt)
```
```{r }


kable(dt) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)
```
